Hello. My name is Katerra Stamps and I am a coder/programmer. I am a senior at Prairie View A&M University. I have a passion for problem solving and I am currently interning with Medtronic. In addition to that, I am developing an app with my programming team Panthers Who Byte. The app aims to address the high mortality rate among minority women in low income areas. For more information on our venture and/or ways to get involved please contact me.
